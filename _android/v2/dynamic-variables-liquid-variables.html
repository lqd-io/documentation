A ***Liquid Variable*** is a variable that holds a dynamic value which can change depending on rules that you define remotely on Liquid dashboard. You can transform any old-fashioned static variable into a ***Liquid Dynamic Variable*** just by replacing them with a Liquid method.

As an example, assume that you want to turn a static background color that was used like:

{% highlight java %}
getResources().getColor(R.color.customColor);
{% endhighlight %}

into a dynamic background color. You just need to replace it with something like:

{% highlight java %}
Liquid.getInstance().getColorVariable("bgcolor", fallbackColor);
{% endhighlight %}

As soon as you compile your code and use this variable in your app, it will appear on your Liquid dashboard.
