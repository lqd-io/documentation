Liquid offers a REST API for reading aggregated data from Liquid servers, called Data Analysis API.

This API has one endpoint available and authentication is mandatory using the app key, e.g.: `uDfNVSzRCOjgvlWCpn7CPx-UCEAA5CPs`. This key is available in your app settings on Liquid dashboard, and it's different from the Data Collection API key.

The current available endpoint is:

| GET | Resource info |
| --- | --- |
| [/users/:id](#get-users) | Used to obtain information about a user.
