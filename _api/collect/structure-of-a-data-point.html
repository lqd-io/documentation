{% capture structure %}

A data point represents a *snapshot* of a device in a certain state, at the moment of an event generation (e.g.: when the user buys a product on their app).

Each datapoint includes 4 entities (`User`, `Device`, `Event` and `Timestamp`):

{% highlight json %}

  "event": {},
  "timestamp": "2016-01-01T00:00:00.000+00:00"
}
