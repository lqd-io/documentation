We strongly recommend you to choose a strong UUID generator algorithm ([at least UUID Version 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)) since the generation of real unique IDs - or at least near real - for devices and anonymous users are extremely important as they uniquely identify a resource.

If the algorithm is not strong-enough to avoid colisions of those unique IDs (e.g. generating two users with the same Unique ID) different users, or devices would be erroneously merged.
