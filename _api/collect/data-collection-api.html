Liquid offers a REST API for sending data to Liquid servers. This data is tipically sent from the official [iOS](https://github.com/lqd-io/liquid-sdk-ios), [Android](https://github.com/lqd-io/liquid-sdk-android) and [Windows](https://github.com/lqd-io/liquid-sdk-windows) SDKs, but as an open API it can also be used directly from backend or other type of clients.

This REST API has two endpoints available and authentication is mandatory, in a per-app basis, by App key for the Data Collection API, e.g.: `vE_S7CluDfNVPx_UgWCpn-5CPszRCOjC`. This key is available in your app settings on Liquid dashboard.

The available endpoints are:

| POST | Resource info |
| --- | --- |
| [**/data_points**](#post-data-points) | Used to create a new data point. The structure of a data point is described [here](#structure-of-a-data-point). |
| [**/aliases**](#post-aliases) | Used to create a new user alias, tipically called when a user changes its unique ID, e.g. when switching from an anonymous to an identified state. |
